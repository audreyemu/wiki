Capture The Flag competitions (CTFs) are cybersecurity competitions where teams solve challenges to win points. These challenges generally involve exploiting some vulnerability in a target piece of code, which contains a secret "flag" (a unique string) that can only be accessed through exploiting said vulnerability. Once someone has figured out the exploit and captured the flag, they submit it for points, hence the name Capture The Flag.

Some common categories of challenges include Binary Exploitation (pwn), Reverse Engineering, Cryptography, and Web Exploitation, to name a few. Don't worry if you don't know what these mean yet, this repository should help with that!
