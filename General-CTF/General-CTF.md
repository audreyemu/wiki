# General CTF resources and tools

This folder contains resources that train you for CTFs in general. These include past CTFs, general tools that you might use during a CTF, and other things too broad to fit into one category.

## picoCTF (resource)

https://picoctf.org/

picoCTF is a CTF competition run by people at Carnegie Mellon University. Their website also contains resources for getting into CTFs, as well as previous years' competitions that you can tackle. Highly recommended for beginners.

## Cyber FastTrack and CyberStart

https://www.cyber-fasttrack.org/

https://play.cyberstart.com/dashboard

Possibly the most beginner friendly cybersecurity resource on this list. Some of the skills learned here are too basic to show up on CTFs, but they're still worth learning. Contact a team captain to join the PBR group on CyberStart.

## CyberChef (tool)

CyberChef describes itself as "The Cyber Swiss Army Knife - a web app for encryption, encoding, compression and data analysis". Very useful.

## pwntools (tool)

https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/

A Python library that helps with writing CTF scripts. You'll be using this a lot.
