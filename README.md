# Welcome to PBR!
Read this if you're new to PBR or CTF competitions!

## What are CTFs
Capture The Flag competitions (CTFs) are cybersecurity competitions where teams solve challenges to win points. These challenges generally involve exploiting some vulnerability in a target piece of code, which contains a secret "flag" (a unique string) that can only be accessed through exploiting said vulnerability. Once someone has figured out the exploit and captured the flag, they submit it for points, hence the name Capture The Flag.

Some common categories of challenges include Binary Exploitation (pwn), Reverse Engineering, Cryptography, and Web Exploitation, to name a few. Don't worry if you don't know what these mean yet, this repository should help with that!

## What is PBR
Psi Beta Rho (abbreviated as PBR) is cybersecurity ~~frat~~ club and UCLA's only competitive CTF team. We have practices every week of the quarter (unless otherwise specified) and compete in CTFs. Our CTF schedule isn't particularly set, we kind of play this by ear, but do try to keep an open hour or two on the weekends in case we are competing.

We also run LA CTF, our own CTF competition that we write the challenges for! If you're interested in challenge writing, talk to a team captain.

## What you can find here
This repository contains a whole bunch of things that we think are useful for preparing you for CTFs - websites, code examples, etc. Whether you're completely new to CTFs or a veteran competitor, we hope you find these resources useful!

In each folder (besides PBR), you'll find a document explaining what that topic is, with links to resources you can use to learn or practice in that category. You might also find code other PBR members wrote that you can use as examples to work off of.

In the PBR folder, you'll find information about PBR itself, as well as current members. If you want to ask questions but don't know who to talk to, look there!
