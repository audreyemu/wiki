# General CTF resources and tools

This folder contains resources that train you for CTFs in general. These include past CTFs, general tools that you might use during a CTF, and other things too broad to fit into one category.

## Resources

### picoCTF
https://picoctf.org/
picoCTF is a CTF competition run by people at Carnegie Mellon University. Their website also contains resources for getting into CTFs, as well as previous years' competitions that you can tackle. Highly recommended for beginners.

### Cyber FastTrack and CyberStart
https://www.cyber-fasttrack.org/
https://play.cyberstart.com/dashboard
Possibly the most beginner friendly cybersecurity resource on this list. Some of the skills learned here are too basic to show up on CTFs, but they're still worth learning. Contact a team captain to join the PBR group on CyberStart.
